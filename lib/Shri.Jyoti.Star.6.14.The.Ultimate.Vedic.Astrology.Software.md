Shri Jyoti Star 6 14 is based on the principles of Vedic Astrology, which is also known as Jyotish, the science of light. Vedic Astrology is an ancient system of knowledge that originated in India and has been practiced for thousands of years. It is based on the belief that the planets and stars influence our lives and destiny, and that by studying their movements and positions, we can gain insight into ourselves and our world.
 
Vedic Astrology uses a different zodiac than Western Astrology, called the sidereal zodiac, which is based on the actual positions of the constellations in the sky. It also uses a different system of houses, called the Bhavas, which are based on the rising sign or ascendant. Vedic Astrology also employs many unique techniques and concepts, such as the Nakshatras (lunar mansions), the Dashas (planetary periods), the Yogas (planetary combinations), the Karakas (significators), the Vargas (divisional charts) and many more.
 
Shri Jyoti Star 6 14 is designed to help you explore and apply all these aspects of Vedic Astrology in an easy and intuitive way. You can create and analyze charts for yourself and others, using various styles and options. You can also generate reports and predictions based on different methods and criteria.
